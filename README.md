Liver cirrhosis, a terminal outcome of chronic liver damage, necessitates non-invasive assessment to overcome biopsy limitations. This study examines primary biliary cirrhosis using Explainable AI (XAI) to enhance transparency in machine learning (ML) models. Unlike prior works focused on imaging modalities, it highlights serum biomarkers and achieves 90.5% accuracy via XGBoost. The proposed XAI approach aids healthcare professionals by explaining key predictive features, improving diagnosis
